# NetworkX Examples
Examples on how to use NetworkX and GeoPandas in Python.

Used in an undergraduate Operations Research course at Oklahoma State University (IEM 4013)

[NX1_Basics.ipynb](https://github.com/AustinLBuchanan/NetworkX-Examples/blob/main/NX1_Basics.ipynb) shows how to:
  - create a graph object
  - add vertices
  - add edges
  - query the neighbors of a node
  
[NX2_Attributes_and_Algorithms.ipynb](https://github.com/AustinLBuchanan/NetworkX-Examples/blob/main/NX2_Attributes_and_Algorithms.ipynb) shows how to:
  - add node attributes
  - add edge attributes
  - add graph attributes
  - check if a graph is connected
  - check if a subgraph is connected
  - compute unweighted (i.e., hop-based) distances
  - compute weighted distances
  
[NX3_Reading_Graphs.ipynb](https://github.com/AustinLBuchanan/NetworkX-Examples/blob/main/NX3_Reading_Graphs.ipynb) shows how to:
  - read a graph from file (if stored as a list of edges)
  - draw a graph
  
[NX4_GeoPandas.ipynb](https://github.com/AustinLBuchanan/NetworkX-Examples/blob/main/NX4_GeoPandas.ipynb) shows how to:
  - read a graph from a .json file (using the GerryChain reader)
  - query the name of a node
  - query the population of a node
  - read a shapefile with GeoPandas
  - draw a single district with GeoPandas
